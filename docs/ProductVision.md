2. Validation  
3. Branding  
4. MVP Generation  
5. Launch Strategy  
6. Business Formation  
7. IP Protection  
8. Operational Setup  

Each phase builds on the last. Users can explore, iterate, and lock in decisions as they go. VenturePilot reduces startup friction to nearâ€‘zero â€” no technical expertise required.
